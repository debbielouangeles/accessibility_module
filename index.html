		<h2>Introduction</h2>

Upon completion of the course, you will receive an Accessibility Training Certificate that you will need to submit to your department chair <strong>and</strong> the distance education coordinator along with all other badges and training certificates before the start of your first online teaching assignment. For any questions regarding certification requirements, please contact your department chair or your distance education coordinator.</blockquote>

		<h2>Our Why</h2>
		<p>Accessibility, especially within an online course, is a vital element of equitable online learning. As difficult as college education may be for everyone, there is an added layer of frustration for those who must navigate our courses differently. To get an idea of the difficulties our students face daily when navigating online, take a moment to watch this 11-minute video from Portland Community College.</p>
